<p style="font-family: 'Courier New;">Setting the right sales targets for employees is a difficult balancing act, with long-term consequences on growth and morale.
    <br>Setting a target too low, making it easily achievable, might cause an an employee to not put in the effort. 
    <br>Setting a target too high can be equally problematic. “Then there is no chance of meeting it,” says Doug J. Chung, MBA Class of 1962 Associate Professor of Business Administration in the Marketing unit at Harvard Business School.
    <br> "The salesperson will be discouraged, and just as unlikely to work to their full potential."
    <br>Chung’s prime area of research lies in finding the sweet spot between these two undesirable outcomes, and determining how compensation can motivate salespeople best. In a recent Harvard Business Review article, Chung and several executives from the consulting firm McKinsey & Co explored a new way to thread that needle: using advanced analytics that incorporate artificial intelligence (AI).

    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New;"><b>Putting artificial intelligence to work</b>
    <br>Artificial intelligence—an array of approaches that rely on computer systems and algorithms to handle human tasks—allows companies to use multiple variables to compute the best targets for employees,
    <br> often in real time. Many companies have started using machine-learning algorithms to construct AI systems.
    <br><b>Such algorithms can take two forms:</b>
    <br>Supervised learning. In this approach, using labeled data, the algorithm learns to predict the outcome from the input data.
    <br>Unsupervised learning. In this case, using unlabeled data, the algorithm learns the inherent structure from the input data.

    <dl style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
    <dt> Algorithm </dt>
    <dd>An algorithm is a set of instructions designed to perform a specific task. This can be a simple process, such as multiplying two numbers, 
       <br> or a complex operation, such as playing a compressed video file. ... In computer programming, algorithms are often created as functions.
    </dd> <br>

    <dt>Supervised learning</dt>
    <dd>The machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. ... 
        <br>A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples.
    </dd><br>

    <dt>Unsupervised learning</dt>
    <dd>It refers to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to identify patterns in data sets containing data points that are neither classified nor labeled. ... 
        <br>Additionally, subjecting a system to unsupervised learning is one way of testing AI.
    </dd> <br>

    <dt>Machine</dt>
    <dd>A machine is a thing that is created by people to make work easier. It is a tool or invention which multiplies the effect of human effort. The machine produces a mechanical advantage. ... 
        <br>Often a machine will change one form of energy to another form of energy. Simple machines increase or change the direction of a force.</dd> <br>

    <dt>Variables</dt>
    <dd>A variable is a special type of amount or quantity with an unknown value.</dd> <br>

    <dt>Data</dt>
    <dd>Data is defined as facts or figures, or information that's stored in or used by a computer.</dd><br>

    <dt>Program</dt>
    <dd>A program (noun) is executable software that runs on a computer. It is similar to a script, but is often much larger in size and does not require a scripting engine to run.
        <br> Instead, a program consists of compiled code that can run directly from the computer's operating system</dd><br>
    
    <dt>Input data</dt>
    <dd>A computer file that contains data that serve as input to a device or program. input file. computer science, computing - 
        <br>the branch of engineering science that studies (with the aid of computers) computable processes and structures.</dd> <br>
      
    <dt>System</dt>
    <dd>A system is an organized collection of parts (or subsystems) that are highly integrated to accomplish an overall goal. 
        <br>The system has various inputs, which go through certain processes to produce certain outputs, which together, accomplish the overall desired goal for the system.</dd> <br>
    
     <dt>Analytics</dt> 
     <dd>The systematic computational analysis of data or statistics,information resulting from the systematic analysis or statistics.</dd> <br>
