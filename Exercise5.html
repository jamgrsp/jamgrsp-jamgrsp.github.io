            <p style="font-family: Courier New;">
                Turon is one of the Filipino desserts that is easiest to cook and prepare. 
                Its primary ingredient, the saba banana is wrapped in a spring roll wrapper and then deep fried in a boiling oil with melted brown sugar 
                and the result is a caramelized perfection. For a more special occasion, it can be topped with a scoop of ice cream.

                <br>Bananas are common in the country regardless of the season so you can find this local dessert all year round. 
                Most locals prefer to eat turon during afternoon siesta or it can serve as snacks when entertaining a guest. 
                It can either be paired with a hot or cold drink.

            <p style="font-family: Courier New;">
                    Mango Float is the Filipino version of the Italian Tiramisu. 
                    However, instead of ladyfingers dipped in coffee and layered with a delicious and creamy mixture of other ingredients, 
                    the Mango Float uses local ingredients: a local brand of Graham crackers, condensed milk, heavy cream, and its main source of flavor mango.

                    <br>The mangoes can be sliced or mashed depending on the preference. 
                    First, the crackers are arranged to form a flat layer (others use crushed crackers) as a base. 
                    The mixture of cream and condensed milk forms another layer and the next layer is for the mango slices (or paste). 
                    The same process is followed until the tub is filled up.

                    <br>The dessert is refrigerated for 12-24 hours for the ingredients to settle and the flavors to sip through the crackers.
                    It is then served chilled and sliced like a cake.
