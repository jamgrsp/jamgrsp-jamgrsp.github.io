        <p style="font-family: Courier New;">
            It is the Filipino dish everybody knows the mighty adobo. It is made by stewing meat (usually chicken, pork, or a combination of both) in soy sauce and vinegar, adding peppercorns and bay leaves for that special flavour.
            Bonus leftovers tip: pull the meat from the bone and fry til crispy for some tasty adobo flakes.

            This rich stew is made with peanut sauce and, customarily, oxtail, but other meatier cuts of beef can also be added in.
            Many Filipinos will consider kare-kare incomplete without a serving of bagoong (fermented seafood paste) on the side.

        <p style="font-family: Courier New;">   
            A merienda (snack in between meals) favourite in the Philippines is Pinoy pork barbecue. 
            While this skewered sweet meat goes wonderfully well with the ubiquitous plain rice during meals, 
            there is also nothing like catching yourself hungry in the middle of the afternoon and conveniently 
            walking down the street over to the vendors grilling them road-side for only PHP15 ($0.30) a stick.
        </p>

    <h4 style="font-family: Courier New;">INGREDIENTS
    </h4>

    <ul>  
        <li><p>With a knife, remove pork skin but leave the fat intact with the meat.
        <li><p>Slice the pork by about ¼” thick. Then cut it to your desired bite size.
        <li><p>For the marinade: In a big bowl, mix all the marinade ingredients. Stir until the sugar is totally dissolved.
        <li><p>Combine the pork with the marinade mixture then keep in a refrigerator for at least 12 hours.
        <li><p>Thread the pork onto skewers.
        <li><p>Grill over the charcoal fire, with at least 3 inches clearance, until the meat turns golden brown. Use the marinade to bash the barbecue during cooking. Add at 1 tablespoon of oil to the marinade so the meat won’t look dry.
        <li><p>Best serve when it still hot.
