                <p>After splitting with the Joker, Harley Quinn joins superheroes Black Canary, Huntress and Renee Montoya to save a young girl from an evil crime lord.

                A twisted tale told by Harley Quinn herself, when Gotham's most nefariously narcissistic villain, Roman Sionis, and his zealous right-hand, Zsasz, 
                put a target on a young girl named Cass, the city is turned upside down looking for her. Harley, Huntress, Black Canary and Renee Montoya's paths 
                collide, and the unlikely foursome have no choice but to team up to take Roman down.

                <p>After a day at school, Ovi Mahajan (Rudhraksh Jaiswal) - son of an incarcerated Indian drug lord - 
                    sneaks out of his house to visit a club, where he is kidnapped by police officers working for rival drug lord Amir Asif (Priyanshu Painyuli). 
                    Saju Rav (Randeep Hooda), a former Para (SF) operator and Ovi's protector, visits Ovi's father in prison. 
                    Unwilling to pay the ransom as it will hurt his prestige, Ovi Mahajan Sr. (Pankaj Tripathi) orders Saju to retrieve his son, threatening Saju's own family.
                    
                    Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth), a black-market mercenary and former SASR operator, is recruited by fellow mercenary Nik Khan (Golshifteh Farahani) to rescue Ovi from Dhaka, 
                    Bangladesh. Rake and Khan's team prepare to extract Ovi, with his father's men set to pay them once Ovi is recovered. Rake rescues Ovi, kills his captors, 
                    and takes him to the extraction point, but his father's men intentionally fail to transfer the funds. Instead, Saju kills Rake's teammates to bring Ovi back himself to 
                    avoid any payment to the mercenary group. Learning of Ovi's escape, Asif orders an immediate lockdown of Dhaka, securing all bridges out of the city.

                <p>During the Han Dynasty in ancient China, the legendary Great Wall fails to keep out the notorious Hun army and their ruthless leader, Shan Yu (Miguel Ferrer). 
                    The alarm is raised, and the Emperor (Pat Morita) entrusts General Li (James Shigeta) with mobilizing an army to protect China. The wise Emperor reminds the 
                    general that "one man may be the difference between victory and defeat."
                    
                    Fa Mulan (Ming-Na Wen), the teenage daughter of prosperous farmer Fa Zhou (Soon-Tek Oh), nervously prepares for her meeting with the village matchmaker 
                    (Miriam Margolyes). Though clever and kindhearted, Mulan is a tomboyish klutz who has little faith in her ability to become a poised and dignified bride. 
                    After rushing through her morning chores, she meets her mother, Fa Li (Freda Foh Shen), and grandmother (June Foray) in town and is bathed and dressed before 
                    joining the other girls at the matchmaker's house ("Honor to Us All"). Mulan's eccentric grandmother insists that Mulan take a live cricket with her for good luck,
                    but the insect escapes from its cage and wreaks havoc at the meeting. Mulan is deemed a disgrace, and is told she will never bring honor to her family.

                <p>A story of two men's deeply troubled odyssey through isolated rural territory, balancing elements of rivalry, deception and treachery, with those of chance, 
                    good fortune and providence. Marshy estuary, barren moorlands, dark woods and windswept sand dunes provide the background setting and for the few people who 
                    survive here, it seems, there is little chance of ever escaping.
                    
                    Peripatetic trader, Vic, spots an incongruously be-suited young man. The younger man, Wes, appears to offer easy pickings for the unscrupulous Vic. But Vic has 
                    failed to take into account the innate qualities of the younger man. After abandoning a blinded Wes deep in the woods, Vic makes his way, alone, to a long sought 
                    hidden camp.

                <p>We take you inside some of the most unusual sex clubs the world had ever known. On the east side of town, a group of out of state businessmen wait patiently for 
                    the girls to arrive. One of the men, a member of a national sex club known only as the "Secret Society," has made a call to the club's central office, and has 
                    requested an evening's entertainment. Being a member in good standing, his desires were not denied. the society flipped through its catalogue of perversions and 
                    arrived at the names office young ladies, three of whom were married, who, themselves society members were available for Friday night orgies. The girls receive no 
                    money for their services, for they, like the men, are only interested in an evening's entertainment. All that is really necessary is that you continue to pay your
                    monthly dues to the "Secret Society." The society's main activities range from the production and distribution of out-and-out stag movies to the scheduling of 
                    abortions. This film shows this sex club in a cold realistic light that your customers will enjoy. Making wide use of hidden cameras, the producers have brought 
                    to the screen an exceptionally accurate account of the nation's wildest sin syndicate.
